## Algorithms & Probability

Second semester course. Concepts in Algorithms & Data Structures are expanded or rivisited, often in a slightly more theoretical/ proof oriented approach. Main topics include:

- More graph algorithms: matchings, coloring, network flows, Eulerian/ Hamilton circles, TSP...
- Introduction to discrete probability: random variables with their main properties, some notable distributions, coupon collector problem, famous inequalities and bounds (Markov, Chebishev, Chernoff). 
- Randomised algorithms (Monte Carlo and Las Vegas). Examples include Min-Cuts, (short) longest paths, target shooting, hashing...
- Geometric algorithms: smallest enclosing circle, Jarvis March, convex hull...

First part of the Information Security course (core course in Theoretical Computer Science). Covered topics include: 

- Basic concepts (encryption vs decryption, private vs public key cryptography, authentication...)
- Perfectly secret schemes (e.g. One Time Pad)
- Authentication alorithms and hash functions: CBC-MAC, NMAC, HMAC... 
- Diffie-Hellmann and RSA algorithms
- Zero knowledge proofs
- Commitment schemes

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Largest course at ETH, it covers many crucial concepts in Machine Learning such as:

- Basics (regression vs classification, bias-variance trade-off, model selection, regularization, how to handle imbalanced datasets...)
- Support Vector Machines, Kernels, Polynomical regression...
- Neural Networks: backpropagation, optimizers, gradient descent, CNNs, GANs...
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoders...)
- Miscellaneous: K-Means algorithm for clustering, Mixture models, generative models...

## Parallel Programming

First year course, that covers many cool topics such as:

- Definition of thread, bad interleaving, race condition, task graph...
- Different ways to achieve mutual exclusion (locks, atomic operations, transactional memory) and their pros/cons
- Low-level implementation of a lock
- Theoretical perspective: Amdahl's and Gustafson's laws, linearizability, (sequential) consistency, consensus, parallel sorting...
